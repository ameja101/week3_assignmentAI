🧠 AI Project Portfolio — Machine Learning, Deep Learning & NLP
📘 Overview

This repository contains three integrated AI projects demonstrating end-to-end skills in:

Classical Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)

Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)

Natural Language Processing (spaCy)

Each task includes preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment or analysis steps.


🧩 Part 1 – Theoretical Understanding

Goal: Demonstrate understanding of foundational AI tools and frameworks.
Includes:

TensorFlow vs PyTorch comparison

Jupyter Notebook use cases

spaCy enhancements for NLP

Comparative analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

📄 Deliverable: Part1_Theoretical_Understanding.pdf

🌿 Task 1 – Classical ML with Scikit-learn

Dataset: Iris Species (Kaggle)

Goal: Train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier.

Steps:

Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode labels).

Train Decision Tree model.

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.

📦 Deliverable: Task1_Iris_Classifier.ipynb

🔢 Task 2 – Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits (TensorFlow Datasets)
Goal: Build a CNN classifier achieving >95% test accuracy.

Steps:

Load and normalize MNIST images.

Design a CNN model using Keras.

Train, evaluate, and visualize predictions.

Deploy using Streamlit for an interactive web demo.

🌐 Streamlit Deployment:
Run locally:

streamlit run app.py


📦 Deliverables:

Task2_MNIST_CNN.ipynb

Task2_Streamlit_App/app.py

💬 Task 3 – NLP with spaCy

Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews (Kaggle)

Goal: Perform NER and sentiment analysis.

Steps:

Extract product names and brands using spaCy’s NER.

Analyze sentiment via a rule-based system.

Display entities and sentiment results.

📦 Deliverable: Task3_SpaCy_NLP.ipynb

⚖️ Part 3 – Ethics & Optimization

Focus: Address bias and model fairness in MNIST and Amazon Reviews.
Includes:

Ethical considerations and bias mitigation (e.g., Fairness Indicators, rule-based filtering).

Troubleshooting and debugging TensorFlow scripts.
